## 👤 Account:

**Three type of account on linux** 
```
1. Root account:      Main Account with full power.
2. Service account:   Installed with package
3. User account:      Accounts with some power if it is given 
```

## 📂 Four type of Administration Files
```
/etc/passwd  : User account full information
/etc/shadow  : User encrypted password
/etc/group   : hold group information
/etc/gshadow : hold group’s encrypted password

```

## 🔐 Password Encryption Algorithms

Prefix in /etc/shadow indicates hashing algorithm:
```
- $6$ : means used SHA512
- $1$ : MD5
- $2a : Bluefish
- $5$ : SHA256
```
## 🧑‍💻 Managing users & groups commands
```
- useradd  : add account
- usermod  : modify account attribute
- userdel  : delete accounts
- groupadd : add groups
- groupmod : modifies groups
- groupdel : remove groups
```

## 🔏 Permissions
**grants access to system resources, files, and folders and tell what you can do on the system.**
```
- **r → read [4]** 
- **w → write [2]**
- **x → executable [1]**
- **_ → no permission. [0]**
```
```

_ r w x r _ _ _ w _ 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ] ⇒ Total 10 character

```
0 → type ( whether file or directory (In linux folder is called directory) )
- **`_`** : Regular file
- **`d`**: Directory
- **`l`**: Symbolic link
- **`c`**: Character device
- **`b`**: Block device
- **`p`**: Named pipe (FIFO)
- **`s`**: Socket
- **`D`**: Door (used in some systems like Solaris)
- **`L`**: Link file (hard link)

**{1 2 3} → permission for user, In this case a user has rwx permission (read, write, execute)**

**{4 5 6} → permission for groups, In this case a groups has only r read permission.**

**{7 8 9} → permission for other users ( neither user nor group member ). In this case they have only write permission .**

**How to assign permissions? Using chmod command. Example → chmod +x filename (replace filename with your files and with + assign permission)**

~ **Note** Ensure you have proper power or privilege for assigning permissions to the files.

## 🎚 Process Priority (nice & renice)
Nice cmd is used to set priority of the process . for non -root user the range belongs to +0 — +19 least priority 

` nice -n+15 find / -name “file-name” `

for security reasons user limitation can be set by configuring limit.conf file 

`/etc/security/limits.conf`

renice - cmd is used to change the priority of running process .

`renice +15 -p 1163 ` [ -p is for process id flag 1163 is pid for GID -g and for UID -u ]

# **1️⃣ Shell Types & Differences (bash, sh, zsh, dash)**

```
bash     → Most common shell on Linux distros
sh       → POSIX-compliant minimal shell
zsh      → Advanced shell with themes & auto-suggestions
dash     → Faster, lightweight shell (Ubuntu uses for /bin/sh)
```

**Add:** How to check current shell

```
echo $SHELL
```

---

# **2️⃣ Environment Variables (VERY important)**

Examples to add:

```
printenv          Show all environment variables
export VAR=value  Create environment variable
PATH              Path used to search commands
HOME              User’s home directory
PWD               Current directory
```

# **3️⃣ File Redirection & Pipes**

This is ESSENTIAL for beginners.

```
>      Redirect output (overwrite)
>>     Redirect output (append)
<      Redirect input
|      Pipe output to another command
2>     Redirect errors
&>     Redirect everything
```

Examples:

```
ls > out.txt
ls | grep "txt"
```

---

# **4️⃣ Wildcards & Globbing**

```
*     Match anything
?     Match single character
[ ]   Match from a set
```

Example:

```
ls *.txt
```

---

# **5️⃣ Process Management (Advanced)**

Add small systemd examples:

### **Start/Stop/Status**

```
systemctl start apache2
systemctl stop apache2
systemctl restart apache2
systemctl status apache2
```

### **Enable Autostart**

```
systemctl enable service
systemctl disable service
```

---

# **6️⃣ Disk & Storage Commands**

## Linux File System Hierarchy

**In Linux, everything is organized in a hierarchical directory structure. The root directory (`/`) is the top-most directory, and everything else is stored under it.**

## Common Directories in Linux
| **Directory** | **Description** | **Example Usage** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | **Root Directory** | The top-level directory where everything begins. All files and directories are under `/`. |
| `/bin` | **Binary Executable** | Contains essential system commands and binaries (like `ls`, `cp`, `cat`). |
| `/boot` | **Boot Files** | Contains files needed to boot the system (e.g., kernel files). |
| `/dev` | **Device Files** | Contains device files for hardware (e.g., `/dev/sda` for a hard drive). |
| `/etc` | **Configuration Files** | Contains system-wide configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd` for user information). |
| `/home` | **User Home Directories** | Each user has a personal directory here (e.g., `/home/john` for user "john"). |
| `/lib` | **Shared Libraries** | Contains system libraries needed by binaries (like `libc` for system calls). |
| `/media` | **Removable Media** | Mounted external devices (USB, CD/DVD drives, etc.) are found here. |
| `/mnt` | **Temporary Mount Points** | Used for temporarily mounting storage devices. |
| `/opt` | **Optional Software** | Contains optional software and third-party applications. |
| `/proc` | **Virtual File System** | Contains system and process information (e.g., `/proc/cpuinfo` for CPU details). |
| `/root` | **Root User’s Home Directory** | Home directory for the root user (the superuser). |
| `/run` | **Runtime Data** | Contains system information about the current boot session (e.g., running processes). |
| `/sbin` | **System Binaries** | Contains essential system binaries used by the superuser for system management. |
| `/srv` | **Service Data** | Contains data for services provided by the system (e.g., web server data). |
| `/sys` | **System Information** | Contains information about system devices and kernel. |
| `/tmp` | **Temporary Files** | Used for storing temporary files created by applications. |
| `/usr` | **User Programs and Data** | Contains non-essential user applications and files (e.g., `/usr/bin` for user binaries, `/usr/lib` for libraries). |
| `/var` | **Variable Files** | Contains files that vary in size, such as logs (`/var/log`), mail (`/var/mail`), and databases. |
