## Data Communication: 
Data communication means two exchange the data between two or more nodes or devices. the effectiveness of data comm. is depend upon 4 characteristic .

### Delivery :
data must deliver to correct destination .

### Accuracy :
The system must deliver data accurately 

### Timeliness :
The system must deliver the data in timely manner. data deliver late means useless, exâ€” Video and audio timely deliver means data that are producing in the same order they are produce and without significant delay. This kind of delivery is called real-time transmission. 

### Jitter :
jitter refers to variation in packet arrival time

### Network protocols
A network protocol is a set of rules for communication between devices on a network. It determines the format, timing, and flow of information exchanges between devices to ensure successful communication. Think of it as a common language for computers to communicate with each other over a network. **HTTP, SMTP, DHCP, FTP, Telnet, SNMP , TCP , IP , UDP , POP.**

### OSI Model:

# OSI model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a framework/reference model that tell how the data is transmitted between computers over a network.
 - 7 different layers -> Each of which is responsible for performing a specific task.
   - These layers are:

1. **Physical Layer:** This layer deals with the physical components of the network, such as cables, transmitters, and receivers.
2. **Data Link Layer:** This layer is responsible for the reliable delivery of data over the physical layer by adding error checking and flow control to the data.
3. **Network Layer:** This layer provides the routing and addressing of data, allowing it to travel from one network to another.
4. **Transport Layer:** This layer is responsible for ensuring that data is transmitted reliably and in the correct order, by using techniques like flow control and error correction.
5. **Session Layer:** This layer manages the communication sessions between applications and ensures that the data is transmitted in an orderly manner.
6. **Presentation Layer:** This layer deals with the format and compression of data, ensuring that it can be understood by the application.
7. **Application Layer:** This layer is the highest layer and deals with the user-end applications and services, such as email and web browsing.

Each layer of the OSI model communicates with the layer above and below it, allowing data to be transmitted from one computer to another in a standardized and organized way
