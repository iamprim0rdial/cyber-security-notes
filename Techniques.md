## Obfuscation is a technique that makes code or data more difficult to understand or analyze. It's often used by malware writers to evade detection. 
### Here are some obfuscation methods:

- **Control flow obfuscation:** This technique modifies the control flow of a program to make it harder to understand how each function works. For example, control flow flattening replaces the normal control flow with a state machine.
- **Arithmetic obfuscation:** This technique replaces arithmetic calculations with mathematical equivalents that are harder to understand.
- **Debug obfuscation:** This technique removes or masks redundant debug details from code.
- **Data obfuscation:** This technique modifies sensitive data to make it less valuable to unauthorized intruders. Techniques include encryption, tokenization, or masking.
- **Layout obfuscation:** This technique rearranges operations in software to make it difficult to follow the software's flow.
- **Code transposition:** This technique transforms code while maintaining its practicality, making it difficult to reverse engineer.
- **Runtime polymorphism:** This technique changes the appearance of malware in run-time to avoid detection.


## Web application firewall
Knowing the application firewall behind the web is very crucial thing to know . because WAF (Web application firewall ) block some of your request if it is not meet the policies . WAF work on set of rules known as policies . If you know the firewall behind your testing web application your are going to save your time .
